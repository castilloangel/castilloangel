- 👋 Hi, I’m @castilloangel
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and developing in php and python. I was a programmer in the 90s and early 2000's but turned over to systems administration and have only programmed in a special CASE tool called genexus ever since. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning php from scratch, including learning github again and refreshing myself on html, css, javascript, http. etc. I'm following this guide https://github.com/thecodeholic/php-developer-roadmap
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing much right now since I'm pretty new to the current programming languages. I know programming languages theory but I have to learn a lot to become proficient in any particular one. 
- 📫 How to reach me email me at castillo.angel@gmail.com
